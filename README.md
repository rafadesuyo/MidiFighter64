# MidiFighter64
A Unreal Engine Application for midi controllers.
This project allows you to plug your midi controller and play music, just like a midi fighter can! It needs some adjustments to easily switch soundtracks but it works fine for now.
How it works:
-Detects if you have a midi device connected
-If you play a note on your midi ( that is tracked ) the note will play a sound of your choice.
-Each note is mapped with a different neon color, easily adjustable.
